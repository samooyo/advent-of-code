# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions in Rust

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges, implemented in Rust. Each day's solution is organized in a separate module within the `src/days` directory.

## Usage

To run the solution for each days, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run run <day-number>
```

Feel free to explore the solutions and provide feedback or improvements! Happy coding!
