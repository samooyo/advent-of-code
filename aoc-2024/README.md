# Advent of Code Solutions in Rust

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges for both 2023 and 2024, implemented in Rust. Each year's challenges are organized in their respective folders.

## Folders

- [aoc-2023](./aoc-2023/): Solutions for Advent of Code 2023.
- [aoc-2024](./aoc-2024/): Solutions for Advent of Code 2024.

## Running a Solution

Each day's solution is implemented in Rust. To run the solution for a specific day:

1. Navigate to the folder for the corresponding year:

   ```bash
   cd aoc-2023  # Or cd aoc-2024
   ```

2. Run the solution for the desired day:

   ```bash
   cargo run run <day-number> # E.g., cargo run run 24
   ```

## Feedback and Contributions

Feel free to explore the solutions, provide feedback, or suggest improvements.

Happy coding and enjoy the puzzles! ðŸŽ„âœ¨
